For Dockerfile inside client and server, remember to include .dokerignore to hide node_module folder otherwise server error

Steps for running the docker-compose file
1. docker-compose build
2. docker-comopse up
3. We can also separately start the server and client by using " docker run <image_no>"
(In order to get docker images, "docker images")
